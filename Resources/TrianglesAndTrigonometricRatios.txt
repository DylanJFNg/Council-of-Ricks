Trigonometry involves calculating angles and sides in triangles.
The three sides of a right-angled triangle have specific names.
The hypotenuse () is the longest side. It is opposite the right angle.
The opposite side () is opposite the angle in question ().
The adjacent side () is next to the angle in question ().
Three trigonometric ratios
Trigonometry involves three ratios - sine (sin), cosine (cos) and tangent (tan).
The three ratios can be found by calculating the ratio of two sides of a right-angled triangle.

Accurate trigonometric ratios for 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°
The trigonometric ratios for the angles 30°, 45° and 60° can be calculated using two special triangles.
An equilateral triangle with side lengths of 2 cm can be used to calculate accurate values for the trigonometric ratios of 30° and 60°.
The equilateral triangle can be split into two right-angled triangles.

The length of the third side of the triangle can be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem (see later)

A calculator can be used to find cos,sin and tan.





Pythagoras' theorem
The longest side of a right-angled triangle is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle.

Draw a square on each side of a right-angled triangle. Calculate the area of each square.

The area of the largest square is the sum of the area of the other two squares.

This is Pythagoras' theorem.
Pythagoras' theorem states that, in any right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
If the sides of the right-angled triangle are labelled ,  and  then Pythagoras' theorem states: 
a^2+b^2=c^2
